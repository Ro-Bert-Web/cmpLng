This command does exactly as you would expect. It averages the two inputs. Unfortunatly, because RobotC does not support array lists, I could not make it work with a variable amount of inputs.
   </p>
   <h1 id = "use">How to Use</h1>
   <iframe src = "Code/Avg.c"></iframe>
   <p>
When using the average function, you input two values. The output will be the average of those two values.
