The greater than function behaves rather simply. All it does, is it takes the two inputs, and checks if the first value is greater than the second value. If so, it outputs a one.
   <h1 id = "max">Max</h1>
   <p>
The maximum function is a branch off of the greater than function. It, instead of outputing whether or not the first value is greater tham the second value, it outputs the greater of the two. If you input a three and a five, it will output a five. If you input a seven and a two, it will output a seven.
   </p>
   <h1 id = "min">Min</h1>
   <p>
The minimum function does the exact same as the maximum value, but it outputs the lesser of the two values.

   <p>
In all the greater than function, maximum function, and minimum functions, you input two values. The greater than function will return one if the first value is greater than the second, otherwise, it outputs zero. The maximum function will return the larger of the two values while the minimum function will return the smaller of the two values.
