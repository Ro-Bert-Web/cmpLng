The bound function behaves very similarily to the mapping function. The only difference is what happens beyond the two fixed x values. Its code equivalent of it is constraining a mapped function to the two y values. This would be used for the very same reasons for using the mapping function, auto-correction, but it maxes out the values. So if you want a part of your robot to auto-correct, but never go too fast, this will keep it within those speeds.

The bound function works exaclty like the <a href = "Samples-Map.html" style = "text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold;">map</a> function, besides the fact that it also constrains the output between the two y values. This is useful if you either want a motor never to be going faster than a certain speed while auto-correcting (for more precision), or you are using Natural Language to start your motors.
